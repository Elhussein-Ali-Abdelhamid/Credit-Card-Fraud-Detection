This project uses machine learning (Logistic Regression) to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Steps
- Data loading and exploration
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
- Model training with Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results
- Achieved good recall on the minority class (fraud)
- Used SMOTE to balance dataset and improve detection

## Tools
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Jupyter
